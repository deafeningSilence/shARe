shARe is an android augmented-reality application that lets diners at a restaurant view the dishes being offered by the restaurant right from their table in 3D view and also place orders from their table.

## what does shARe solve?

whenever a person enters a restaurant, he might hesitate to order new dishes because he has no idea what the dish is. Just listing out the ingredients is probably a very basic way of presenting the dish from the restaurant's point of view. In such a case, shARe provides a complete 3D view of the dish in augmented reality. Thus the the diner knows what the dish looks like in addition to the ingridients. Thus,by using shARe, the restaurant gets to improve it's presentation and attract customers, and help the customers in better decision making.
